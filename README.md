# MACD. This program uses the pandas and numpy libraries to load the data and perform calculations, and the talib library to calculate the MACD. The program then implements a simple strategy of buying when the MACD crosses above the signal line and selling when it crosses below. The positions are stored in a positions array, and the returns are calculated as the difference between successive closing prices multiplied by the positions. Finally, the final returns are printed.
